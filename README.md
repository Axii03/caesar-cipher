# caesar-cipher
Caesar Cipher program in Python
# Caesar Cipher Python Project

## Description
This is a Python project that implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

The project includes a Python script that allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher. It provides a command-line interface where users can specify the shift value and input text.

## Features
- Encryption: Allows users to encrypt plaintext messages using the Caesar cipher.
- Decryption: Allows users to decrypt ciphertext messages using the Caesar cipher.
- Customizable Shift: Users can specify the shift value (number of positions to shift) for encryption and decryption.
- Supports Alphabets: The script supports both uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
- Command-Line Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive command-line interface for interacting with the cipher.
